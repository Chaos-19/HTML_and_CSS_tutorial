    <p>They say I'm growing,
      But each day I'm just falling apart and missing home,
      I stay crowded,
      But it still feels lonely within,
      And even the voices in my head have left me alone!
      I know I've a covered a long way,
      And I'm too far from the start,
      But it still feels I haven't changed even a bit,
      My fears are still the same,
      It just seems I've lost my path!
      I Run, I stumble, I fall,
      I try too hard but can't win the race,
      They say, 'It was easy,
      You could have excelled it, with grace'.
      They say 'it isn't as hard as you make it to be',
      'It doesn't hurt as much as you feel',
      Maybe I'm wrong,
      Maybe I do too much while they do it precisely!
      Maybe I'm thinking too much,
      But now things don't feel the way I used to feel,
      I wish I could be the person I used to be!</p>
